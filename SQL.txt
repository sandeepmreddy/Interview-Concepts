SQL VS NOSQL

Nth Highest salary
select * from(
select ename, sal, dense_rank() 
over(order by sal desc)r from Employee) 
where r=&n;

Query performance:

2. Avoid * in SELECT statement. Give the name of columns which you require.

6. Avoid Having Clause. Having clause is required if you further wish to filter the result of an aggregations.
7. Create Indexes.
10. Drop unused Indexes.
12. Use joins instead of sub-queries.
13. Use WHERE expressions to limit the size of result tables that are created with joins.1
17. Avoid Cursors since cursor are very slow in performance.
21. Use Stored Procedure for frequently used data and more complex queries.
22. Keep transaction as small as possible since transaction lock the processing tables data and may results into deadlocks.
