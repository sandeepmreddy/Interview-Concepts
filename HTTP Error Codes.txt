Sure! Here are the top 10 popular HTTP status codes along with their meanings:

1. **200 OK**
   - The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response depends on the method used in the request.

2. **201 Created**
   - The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

3. **204 No Content**
   - The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

4. **301 Moved Permanently**
   - The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.

5. **302 Found**
   - The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client should continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.

6. **400 Bad Request**
   - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

7. **401 Unauthorized**
   - Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.

8. **403 Forbidden**
   - The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource.

9. **404 Not Found**
   - The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

10. **500 Internal Server Error**
    - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.

These HTTP status codes are widely used and recognized in web development and API design, providing essential information about the result of a request and guiding the client on what action to take next.
