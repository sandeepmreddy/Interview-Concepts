Container(Docker) vs VM
--------------
VMs emulate an entire physical computer, including hardware, operating system, and user-space applications. 
Containers, on the other hand, are built on top of the host operating system and share the kernel of the host with other containers.

Docker containers are more lightweight than VMs, as they do not require a separate operating system instance for each container.

VDI vs VM
-----------

VDI is designed to provide users with a desktop experience that is similar to a physical desktop computer, 
while VMs typically do not provide a desktop experience and are accessed via command line or remote access tools.
