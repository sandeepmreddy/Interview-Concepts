**Main Purposes of an API Gateway:**

1. **Request Routing:**

   * Routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice.

2. **Security (Authentication & Authorization):**

   * Verifies user credentials (e.g., via JWT, OAuth2).
   * Can restrict access to certain services.

3. **Load Balancing:**

   * Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service.

4. **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**

   * Limits the number of requests to prevent abuse.

5. **Caching:**

   * Caches common responses to improve performance.

6. **Request/Response Transformation:**

   * Modifies request or response formats (e.g., converting XML to JSON).

7. **Logging & Monitoring:**

   * Captures logs and metrics for observability and debugging.

8. **Centralized Error Handling:**

   * Handles common error responses and formatting in a consistent way.
