Q)Static methods can be overiden?
A)No.A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable.
Q)How do you use authentication and Authorization?
authentication in filter like Security Filter
Authorization is using JWt token
Q)What is Race condition in java?

Race condition in Java occurs in a multi-threaded environment when more than one thread try to access a shared resource (modify, write) at the same time. Since multiple threads try to race each other to finish executing a method thus the name race condition.

Q)How to avoid Race condition in java?
Race conditions can be avoided by proper thread synchronization in critical sections. Thread synchronization can be achieved using a synchronized block of Java code. Thread synchronization can also be achieved using other synchronization constructs like locks or atomic variables like java.

Q)What is atomic variables in java?

The most commonly used atomic variable classes in Java are AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicBoolean, and AtomicReference. set() â€“ writes the value to memory, so that the change is visible to other threads; equivalent to writing a volatile variable.

Q)Voltaile Atomic VS 

here are two important concepts in multithreading environment:

atomicity
visibility
The volatile keyword eradicates visibility problems, but it does not deal with atomicity. volatile will prevent the compiler from reordering instructions which involve a write and a subsequent read of a volatile variable; e.g. k++. Here, k++ is not a single machine instruction, but three:

copy the value to a register;
increment the value;
place it back.
So, even if you declare a variable as volatile, this will not make this operation atomic; this means another thread can see a intermediate result which is a stale or unwanted value for the other thread.
