Serializable Interface in Java:
1. The Serializable interface is present in java.io package. It is a marker interface. 
A Marker Interface does not have any methods and fields.
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
 Serialization is done using ObjectOutputStream. 
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. 
This mechanism is used to persist the object. Deserialization is done using ObjectInputStream. 

2. public static class Student implements Serializable 

Serialization Object -->ByteStream
De Serialization ByteStream-->Object

3. HashMap Internal implementation
index = hashCode(key) & (n-1)

Custom HaspMap

public class Entry<K, V> {

    private K key;
    private V value;
    private Entry<K, V> next;

    public Entry(K key, V value, Entry<K, V> next){
