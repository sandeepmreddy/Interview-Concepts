Java 11, released in September 2018, introduced several new features and enhancements that improve developer productivity and application performance. Here are some of the key features of Java 11:

1. Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters
Java 11 extends the use of the var keyword to lambda expressions. This makes the code more readable and concise.

Copy code
(var x, var y) -> x + y
2. HTTP Client (Standard)
The new java.net.http package provides a modern and feature-rich HTTP client API, which supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. It was introduced as an incubator module in Java 9 and became standardized in Java 11.

java
Copy code
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))
    .build();
HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
System.out.println(response.body());
3. Running Java File with java Command
Java 11 allows you to run a single source code file using the java command without compiling it separately. This feature is useful for scripting and small utilities.

Copy code
java HelloWorld.java
4. Improved Garbage Collection
Java 11 introduces a new garbage collector called ZGC (Z Garbage Collector), which is designed for low-latency and scalable applications.

5. Flight Recorder
Java Flight Recorder (JFR), a low-overhead data collection framework for troubleshooting and profiling Java applications, is now included.

6. Deprecation and Removal of Features
Java 11 deprecates and removes several outdated and unused features, including:

Removal of the java.se.ee module.
Removal of the javafx module.
Removal of the javah tool.
7. New Methods in Standard Library
Several new methods were added to the standard library to simplify common tasks:

String class:

strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing()
isBlank()
lines()
repeat(int count)
Files class:

writeString(), readString()
mismatch()
8. Nest-Based Access Control
This feature introduces a new access control mechanism for nested classes, improving the security and maintainability of code.

9. Unicode 10
Java 11 supports Unicode 10, which includes new characters and symbols.

10. Epsilon Garbage Collector
Epsilon GC is a no-op garbage collector for testing purposes, which allocates memory but does not reclaim it.

11. Dynamic Class-File Constants (JEP 309)
This enhancement extends the constant pool with a new constant-pool form, making it easier to express common patterns in a more efficient manner.

These features and enhancements make Java 11 a significant update, offering improved performance, security, and developer productivity.
